It successfully operated for one year after which it started encountering great money and technical related difficulties which prompted the shutting down of the app in 2014.

The key issue was that the organization did not raise enough income to maintain its tasks as the organization's plan of action depended on the exchange cost. Steadily, their exchanges diminished in cost and 99dresses' income endured a shot. Their plan to scale up to include handbags and different adornments, failed to gain traction and the number of exchanges in the platform dropped.

Difficulties in implementing innovation and absence of management experience likewise added to conveying deals to a stop and caused a drying up in funding sources. The startup also experienced Visa issues that obstructed smooth activities between the United States and Australia. With these series of events, the company’s group of prime supporters gradually gave up on the platform and the startup had to close down.

Anki,"San Francisco, California, United States",Anki is an entertainment robotics company dedicated to bringing artificial intelligence and robotics to people's everyday lives.,anki.com,"Anki barely lasted for a decade and completely ceased operations by the end of April 2019. This is not something you would expect from a company that is a brainchild of Carnegie Mellon graduates, and a company that raised close to $200 million in VC funding. The products that Anki produced were also performing really well in the market and at a competitive price tag of under $300, they seemed to do what their competitors in this industry could not. In fact, according to many sources (like Amazon US), Cozmo was the best selling toy of 2017. So what took this promising startup eventually to the grave?

A failed round of financing was reportedly to blame. CEO Boris Sofman told employees that a deal had failed to materialize “at the last minute”, as it also happened with acquisition interests from companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Comcast.

An article published by The Robot Report provides some more information about Anki’s case. According to it, Silicon Valley Bank had a security interest in Anki’s copyrights, patents, and trademarks since March 30, 2018. To receive a loan from SVB, Anki had to put up its intellectual property as collateral. If Anki failed to repay the loan, SVB had the right to seize the collateral to make up for the money it lost in the loan. The report also stated that Fisher & Richardson, a global IP law firm, filed a lien against Anki on June 3, 2019, because it “has not been compensated for patent and trademark prosecution services that it provided for Anki”.

However, can these financial debacles be the sole reason, or is there something inherent within the robotics industry that is to blame? 

A quick look at the failure of other robotics companies within the last year paints a very clear picture. There needs to be a rethink as to the functionality and not just the novelty factor (which tends to fade out very quickly) when thinking of designing the next successful home robot. It is like what Roomba and Alexa have done within the past decade (specialized and functional robots that actually do the job they are meant for).    

A major failure, for example, was Jibo, founded in 2012 by famed MIT roboticist Cynthia Breazeal (a pioneer researcher in human-robot interaction). Jibo went on to successfully raise over $3.5 million when its Indiegogo campaign ended in 2014. They raised a further $73 million in VC funding and Jibo was touted as the first social robot for the home that would actually dance around for you! Another similar failure was the shutdown of Mayfield Robotics. They had released their famed Kuri robot that was touted as being a roaming security camera with a personality. Both robots came with a high price tag and their novelty wore off among users very soon, leading to their shutdowns in late 2018. 

The epic failure of Cozmo and Vector proved the fact even further that despite a successful product line and competitive price tags if products (no matter how well designed) do not prove their value in the consumer market, they will not lead to a sustainable business model for the companies investing in them."

Argyle Social,"Durham, North Carolina, United States","Argyle Social provided a social media management tools focused around powerful social tools for B2B marketers.

This additional design Argyle Social has is really useful for marketers, but still, the bulk and massive marketing efforts of their competitors, unfortunately, drowned out that value.

The funds were never enough to keep the software in the market, not to mention that the company still had to pay its employees.

Leading social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter change their APIs every time, for the Argyle Social to work, Covati and his team needed to keep up with those changes as well, and that was a huge struggle for them. They had talent and skill but lacked the appropriate number of employees needed to accomplish such task. The company’s lack of employees came about from their first issue, which is not having enough funds. Without the appropriate funds, it was impossible for Argyle to keep their services in the market. Adam Covati said that he tried numerous times to find a willing business partner to keep the company alive, but no company or individual ever found Argyle to be “profit wise”.

Aria Insights,"Danvers, Massachusetts, United States",Aria Insights develops unmanned air vehicles for search and rescue missions and bridge inspections.,www.cyphyworks.com,"There are various reasons why Aria ultimately failed. What they all have in common is that they’re complex in and of themselves. For example, Aria’s founder, Helen Greiner left the company back in 2018. When a company loses its founder, momentum shifts. The core philosophy of the company is being “sucked out” and replaced by someone else. 

Naturally, that’s likely not the only reason. Another reason could have been Aria’s decision to move away from producing drones and drone technology to focusing on developing smart AI systems and drone programs. Aria re-launched in January 2019 and said that a number of their partners were focused on collecting and storing massive amounts of information using Aria’s drones. However, nobody could offer Aria’s partners the possibility to quickly turn the data into actionable insights.

Aria discovered a new possibility in the market that nobody else was offering at that time. And for sure, looking for new ways to serve their clients is always a healthy sign, but this time, Aria took things a little too far.

Since there was no other company offering that particular service, it might have been a sign that demand really wasn’t that big after all. And Aria might have gotten the wrong impression that since their actual partners craved the technology to store and interpret massive amounts of information, that was also the case with the rest of the drone market.

Ultimately that proved not to be the case and quite likely, commercial demand and regulations were just too slow to catch up with the supply of drone solutions.

It’s an example where a company offers a solution to a problem that really doesn’t exist yet on such a large scale that it’s possible to monetize from it. In other words, the company was way ahead of itself.

After months of being in business, reports of management, operational and revenue challenges at the firm arose after an independent auditing company discovered that the auction house was making very few direct deals, members of the company bided on or even bought items on the live sales and the company heavily overstated the amount of profit and sales it made to the public. The organization claimed that the auditing report didn't bring into account private deals and other income streams. The truth of the matter was that none of Auctionata's purported record-breaking online deal accomplishments were ever upheld by real deals. It was additionally noticed that blunders of oversights were a routine at Auctionata which had an embarrassing Yelp! review of 1 star, with customers complaining of everything from delivery times, the alarming disappearance of the items they put on sale on the website (often to be found on eBay) to the complete unresponsiveness of the company representatives. Auctionata, from its part, had the propensity of cleansing all negative data from its records.

The absence of morals, administration mismanagement and the naivety of financial specialists were alarming factors, and so was the willingness of investors to keep funding the startup despite its increasingly dubious reputation and dealings. Auctionata ultimately failed to find new speculators thus filing for bankruptcy and closing down.

At the same time, Beepi was also reported as giving disproportionately high salary and overtimes to its top management.

Besides having failed to manage the financial aspects of the startup, also Beepi’s logistics in buying and selling cars came short. Originally planning to complete an acquisition deal with Fair.com, one of its main competitors, that never happened and the company tried to negotiate with DGDG, but also this deal fell through. The company shut down in December 2016.

When they first launched they were getting too few customers so they started to offer customization and flexibility which gained them happy and paying customers but became costly for Brisk in the long term but they were reluctant to make customers pay for the additional services (which by the way they didn’t know the existence of) as they knew people expected apps to cost but few dollars. So, they tried to push forward until their big break.

With flexibility came a lack of focus, they didn’t know anymore who their customer persona was, what problem where they exactly trying to solve? Permitting many product cases, although not technically challenging, influenced the company to wind up having an exceptionally unfocused advancement, onboarding, and deals.

Lastly one of the founders wondered if the product had ever had a real market fit to begin with and if so, they might have lacked the vision to bring about the needed solution for the problem salespeople experienced.

Back in the day, you couldn’t just type one single word and the search engine would find every, single relevant result, including results ‘near you’, as Google can nowadays. 

No, you really had to dig deep to find exactly what you were looking for. Search engines weren’t as complex as they are now, and their algorithms certainly didn’t do much of the thinking for you. In many cases, you had to manually search at least 3-4 pages of the search engine before you found a decent result, and even then it wasn’t as tailored to your request as it is nowadays. 

If you needed something specific found on the Internet, you needed a librarian who could quickly scout through a number of articles, websites and publications. A lot of the people who really understood how to find information fast on the Internet had a master’s degree because it was so complex and difficult to scour through the tons of information without any proper algorithm. 

However, ChaCha soon got stiff competition. Google released its Panda algorithm back in 2011 that virtually put it as the de facto information source on the Internet. If you searched for something on Google, you would be lucky to find results from sites like ChaCha, Ask.com, and Answers.com. They all got pushed further down. 

Not only that but at its peak, ChaCha had 55,000 virtual employees. They faced big management problems and there were even some cultural issues they had to take care of as well. The costs of hiring people to manual do research simply became too high, when comparing them with the results you could get from Google. And in addition, it became more difficult for the guides to give proper answers on subjective matters like politics, religion and so on. 

Ultimately, hiring people to manually search and give answers to questions wasn’t a sustainable project when Google offered the same thing, only through a simple online search.

In an article titled “Farewell to Circa News” the company stated that producing high-quality news proved to be a costly endeavor and without the capital necessary to support further production they were unable to continue. The company found out that building a revenue stream would take time and only by having enough venture capital they would be able to sustain their operations.

Although their concept was new and innovative, it was quickly copied by giants in the news sector. Circa was unlikely to be able to compete with renowned prints staff nor with their advertising outreach.

Circa was deemed to fail exactly because of the model and strategy it had chosen. Since news were only digests of news they had no strong emotional pull. Users didn’t spend much time on Circa, even after they briefly opened the app, they would go back to the other social and engaging applications that could offer them not only near real-time news but also social interactions.

The company considered monetizing their site by introducing advertisements or charging a subscription for its product but they felt that these minor solutions wouldn’t have made a difference nor provide a high-quality experience to their users, so they decided against it.

CircleBack Lending,"Boca Raton, Florida, United States",CircleBack Lending is an internet-based credit platform for purchasing fixed income assets backed by consumer credit products.,circlebacklending.com,"The company saw some success initially and entered into a partnership with Jefferies Group LLC that was to help with the sale and securitization of $500 million in principal amount of consumer loans. The stated goal of this partnership with an established financial services firm was to provide loans to a much wider segment of the US population, which needed a responsible alternative to traditional bank loans and credit cards.

3 years down the line, the company was exposed in an article by Bloomberg that it had stopped giving out loans. This was mainly a result of borrowers failing to pay their loans.

For starters, in 2014, the company had generated a minuscule $4m in total loans (a year into its founding), but that didn’t stop Jefferies Group LLC from agreeing to securitize up to $500m of its loans. This is nothing new in the fin-tech world as shown by the $5 billion dollar deal that was inked in 2017 by industry leader Prosper (founded in 2005). Prosper Inc., which had been one of the pioneers of the P2P Online lending industry, was one of the earliest to turn to Wall Street to securitize its loans by repackaging them as bonds through the likes of Citigroup and others.

Then there has been a problem with the sudden firing of CEO s and top staff that was a regular occurrence at both Prosper, and Lending Club (another pioneer in the P2P lending business). The unexpected departure of Lending Club’s founding CEO put the entire industry in a tailspin as funding dried up.

Despite this, there seem to be much bigger and more fundamental problems that the entire P2P lending industry is ignoring.

1. With the advent of online banking, and the P2P companies relying on their own credit rating (like FICO), the line between banks and P2P lending has become blurred, and they are constantly diverging from the reason that this industry was founded (providing loans to those seen outside the scope of banks).

2. A far bigger problem that exists is the staggering rate at which P2P companies fail at returning capital to investors. A closer look into the P2P lending industry in China reveals some crucial data. The P2P industry fulfilled a growing need in the country, where bank loans were much harder to get by. But by the end of 2015, there were 1,031 total troubled platforms out of 3,448 platforms still in operation, with most of the problems being people that absconded with the cash. Despite much-needed regulation of the industry starting in 2018, the total number of platforms that went bust as of February 2019 were over 5000, with 177 million RMB ($25 million) in unpaid loans.

Dinner Lab,"New Orleans, Louisiana, United States",Dinner Lab is a membership-based social dining experiment that unites undiscovered chefs with adventurous diners who are looking for,dinnerlab.com,"The first problem Dinner Lab encountered had to do with the timing at which they offered the meals. Originally, the event would take place at midnight, but pretty soon the company team discovered people at 12:00 am of a weekend tended to be drunk and were both unreliable customers and not really enhancing the experience of the other participants. So, although the idea sounded adventurous and fun, it was impractical and people aren’t used to dine at midnight.

According to Dinner Lab CEO, the company was very challenging to manage as there always was a multitude of variables they had to keep up with, from the food served and its ingredients, to the location, diners registration and turnaround and the staff kept on changing.

Although most customers enjoyed the experience, people complained that there were never enough tickets and never enough events going on. In some cities, people who signed up for a membership which would include at least 2 events per month, ended up having only 1 event every 6 weeks while still having to pay a full subscription.

Dinner Lab blamed the difficulty of having more events on the dwindling running capital. They decided to hire contract workers instead of full-timers with the hope that would decrease the cost. Dinner Lab also tried to sell diners’ surveys to restaurants but without success. They finally found the model unsustainable and closed in 2016 after 5 years of operations.

Despite its various ways to raise money (including making it an enterprise), the company failed to become profitable and eventually ran out of cash.

Another reason the company failure could be attributed to was the unreliable volume of demand. The market was already filled with similar products and the competition was too high. When Flud came to be, Flipboard and Pulse were already the leading franchise in the field.

An additional reason the company didn’t ultimately succeed was the lack of initial testing of the product. Moreover, they had sought the press too early on, without having a thoroughly tested product. The large media coverage the app received did Flud more damage than good because people, upon hearing about the app, would download it and try it out. Flud wasn’t expecting to have so many users download the app so soon and en masse, so they had suddenly had to deal with glitches and bugs. Having a faulty app when respected companies were praising it, might have cost them a bit of credibility and stopped the momentum they could have had.

Cyberbullying came to the level that several teen suicides were linked to the bullying that took place on the site.

The startup tried to remedy by collaborating with the MIT Lab to search for a way to discourage cyberbullying. Eventually, the site had to limit the anonymity feature but that meant that it would lose its appeal, users started decreasing and growth simply froze.

If success leaves clues, so does failure. Many platforms that focused solely on anonymous interactions had to pull out the plug because of the predictable type of behavior that people tend to have when they can’t or don’t have to be accountable for their actions, even when those actions directly endangered the psychological or physical well-being of another human being.

He attributed the failure of their platform to not being able “to achieve sustainable product market fit”. Jain went on to say that despite the widespread video consumption in the market, the video creation process seemed to be a challenge.

In fact, it might be unlikely that public figures could find the time to commit to using this specific platform to reply to their followers with vlogs for the long term, especially if there were other platforms that could connect them to an international audience.

The main problem with Gowalla seemed to be that it tried to do and be too many things at once, whereas Foursquare, for one, focused on one or two basic services that users would infallibly go back to.

Gowalla had a better design and was aesthetically more pleasing, and yet FSQ, which launched in the densely populated New York, saw a rapid growth because users recommend it to their friends for the check-in and rewards features it offered and received social validation for using it, since ‘everyone’ was using it.

Funding was also probably not the main problem for the startup as Gowalla raised 3M in investments and partnered with giants such as Disney, National Geographic, and several major U.S. Universities.

Gowalla’s team joined Facebook in December 2011. Facebook claimed that it acquired the app but that it wouldn’t make use of the user data that it had generated over the years. FB representatives stated that they were rather more interested in partnering with the developers that brought forward the startup since they shared similar values and vision and could help enhance certain aspects of FB’s platform.

The reasons for cash shortage were attributed mismanagement of funds to support expenditures unrelated to business such as covering the bills for the founders' partners and spendings unnecessary sums of money on expensive furnitures. At the same time, Beepi was also reported as giving disproportionately high salary and overtimes to its top management.

Besides having failed to manage the financial aspects of the startup, also Beepi’s logistics in buying and selling cars came short. Originally planning to complete an acquisition deal with Fair.com, one of its main competitors, that never happened and the company tried to negotiate with DGDG, but also this deal fell through.

Inui Health,"Sunnyvale, California, United States",Giving qualitative healthcare to people on their smart phone.,www.inuihealth.com,"Elizabeth Holmes was a real sensation in the media, often featured on the covers of various business magazines and lists of top executives and innovators. On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase ""if only I had known sooner."" 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, Bad Blood, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early. ""disgruntled employees"" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry.

The company received funding from high profile firms before users realized that the machines were useless.

The high initial price of $699 was already a barrier for many of its potential customers and the fact that the machine only worked with Wi-Fi was an additional inconvenience. To add to that, the company put a scannable QR code on each packet serving and the machine would not function unless it detected the presence of said code. In other words, people could not press home-made packets but had to order them from Juicero, each packet costed between $5 and $7. After months of slow sales, the company tried to sell its product at $400 and planned to offer a cheaper version in the months to come.

The company received one last blow when Bloomberg News published a video proving that simply by hand squeezing the packets you could obtain a full glass of juice and that the $700 machine was really useless. Few months after that Juicero went bankrupt and has since been classified as another absurd Silicon Valley startup product that raised huge funds but didn’t really solve any real problem.

In order to cope with the recession and maintain their position above the margin, manufacturers started to sell their stored products at heavily discounted prices, this provided online flash sell companies with the perfect momentum to rise and thrive. Once the economy started improving, though, and customers regained their purchasing power, flash sales marketplaces started seeing a steady decrease in sales. At the same time, luxury brands rapidly recovered from the previous economic crisis and continued once again to produce their high-end product. Manufacturers decided to not let their high-end brands sell for bargain prices anymore and abandoned the idea of participating in flash sales in order to maintain their reputation and stable income. This meant that flash sales lost their core attractiveness and became generally obsolete. The momentum ended and so did the future of the company.

Laurel & Wolf,"Los Angeles, California, United States",Laurel & Wolf is the leading online interior design marketplace. We make professional interior design affordable & accessible for everyone.,www.laurelandwolf.com,"Even though Laurel & Wolf generally maintained a positive, marketable image, beginning the summer of 2018, the company’s reviews on sites like Yelp were populated with an influx of mainly one-star rants. Most of the reviewers complained that furniture and other items that they had ordered through the platform either arrived broken or were never delivered. Some clients also complained of having received substandard services and never receiving refunds that they claimed for. As a result of the poor publicity, a majority of Laurel & Wolf’s designers left the platform.

However, dissatisfied customers were not the only cause of Laurel and Wolf’s downfall. The company also had various disgruntled employees that were not happy with how it was being run. Despite this, the company tried to maintain their positive, quirky social image—going as far as having employees at dance classes and bowling excursions showcased on the company’s Instagram account. Behind closed doors, however, the atmosphere did not reflect the company’s joyful facade. For instance, while co-founder Laure Fine presented herself as being generally upbeat in her interviews, most employees recounted their fear of her. On many occasions, she would publicly and bluntly berate anyone that disagreed with her ideas. On top of this, despite being a design-based company, payouts to designers were generally small and were reduced without explanation.

It is hence not too difficult to conclude that Laurel & Wolf’s internal operations were quite chaotic. For a long period, it was running without any dedicated internal accounting, HR, or clear management structure. Moreover, their first office was cramped up and with just one bathroom. When they moved to a new building, it had a range of structural issues, tight packing and has sewage seeping into the ground floor which posed health risks. 

“They have to know they can’t treat people that way.” claimed a worker who quit the company just a few months after joining. “I would get in at about 8:30, and I wasn’t leaving until about 9:00 at night. I thought it was because we were so busy, but actually, the way we did things was just really complicated.” declared another.

Combined with large spendings in marketing and branding, all of these factors led to  Laurel & Wolf’s ultimate downfall. In March of 2019, the company closed its virtual shop and soon after, its website followed.

Leap Transit,"San Francisco, California, United States",Leap Transit is a provider of private transit and offers bus services.,leaptransit.com/,"The primary reason for Leap quick exit from the private transport scene was their failure to comply with the San Francisco regulations. Besides not having requested permission from the city administration, they committed a second infringement when they removed the front door ramp which by law should be present in bus so as to make the vehicle accessible to people with disabilities.

Furthermore, although their service might have been useful, it was seen with a mix of dislike and outrage. The original inhabitant of the city generally seemed to dislike bus services that seemed to be aimed at the new “tech population” that came into the city and they even went so far as to protest their very presence. Another complaint was also that the buses also congested the SF streets.

Leap had not enough passengers to make a decent profit, even if they charged them $6 per ride. When the California Public Utilities Commission issued a cease and desist notice to the company they halted their operations.

Essentially, grocery delivery start-ups have been ‘buying’ customers, who pay no convenience fees to get the groceries delivered to their doorsteps.

Also, when a discount is offered to acquire more customers, it’s the local retailers who grab the cheap groceries from these apps.

The bigger players hope to offset the cash burn with scale, but that has run into problems too. The well-funded Grofers forayed into tier-2 cities but had to beat a hasty retreat when the cost of acquiring customers skyrocketed.

However, leaked reports from the company revealed that Maple was losing money on each delivered meal and it only began making a 30 cents profit on meals from 2016. Although they first relied on their investor’s fundings to cover operational costs, the forecasted losses were too high and they wouldn't be able to sustain it. So, they increased the price, added delivery fee and changed ways of computing sales tax. This sudden price increases led many customers to shift to other providers that offered the same or better services for less money.

Maple also spent a lot to buy expensive grass-fed beef, antibiotic-free chicken and also imported pricey oils. Some sources claim that Maple lacked the operational chops to prepare and deliver meals on scale while maintaining quality and producing a profit. Maple kitchens were also not well equipped to cook 10,000 meals a day.

Furthermore, when Maple launched they used to give a complimentary maple sugar cookie, afterward they withdrew them saying that they were moving away from all kinds of non-natural products to good simple food. This might have ulteriorly displeased customers that became accustomed to the signature free of charge cookie after each order.

MatterFab,"Bloomington, Indiana, United States",MatterFab offers a production 3D metal printer solution that removes the limitations of industrial fabrication.,matterfab.com/,"The Seattle based startup had a promising pitch and a noble cause - Making metal-based additive manufacturing an affordable reality. The company had stated that this is because of the experience of the team, which allows them to pull a dozen different engineering disciplines together and come up with workable solutions. MatterFab had initially shown serious promise, as their 3D printers were supposed to be about 10% of the price of a regular metal 3D printer.

MatterFab received $7.48M funding in February 2015. This was followed by $5.75M in May of that year, making the startup one of the most funded new enterprises in the 3D printing industry. Investors included GE and AutoDesk.

One cause for the failure of this once-promising startup can be stated in the words of Josh Ewing from AutoDesk - “We believed in MatterFab’s approach and vision, but unfortunately it didn’t succeed in the marketplace.”

Dave Warren, who is the co-founder and former CTO had left MatterFab in March 2016 to pursue a career with a Stealth Drone Startup. The other co-founder, Matt Burris had already left in October 2015. The reasoning from the investors' perspectives was that they needed a more experienced management team to lead the business. That team that followed them included Matt Paterson (the CTO brought in to replace Warren), but Patterson himself left MatterFab in March 2017.

A deeper problem besides this was the sad financial state of the company. With over $13 million raised since February 2015, the company appears to have burned through over half a million a month in 2016 alone!

Also, with GE purchasing established metal AM enterprises (like Concept Laser and Arcam) and their plans to launch the world’s largest metal 3D printer (ATLAS), their initial enthusiasm in investing in MatterFab may have evaporated before things could take-off successfully.

They tried refreshing the old content by integrating a new feature which nonetheless was not recognized as something groundbreaking in the era where other social apps with similar features already enjoyed growing popularity.

Moped was unable to see that without significant revenues and with their old and outdated content, they could not stand a chance in competing with other similar social apps. Despite their efforts and the new ideas they implemented, they attracted a disappointingly small group of users but lost a greater amount of its initial user base. The popularity and the number of users saw a steady decrease. That defeat led to the loss of all their revenue and they couldn’t find someone to invest in additional rounds. Moped officially closed and was bought by Berlin-based company 6Wunderkinder which was in turn acquired by Microsoft in 2015.

Munchery,"San Francisco, California, United States",Munchery offers same-day food deliver services.,munchery.com,"Munchery had a very interesting growth story. For the first few years, as a San Francisco-based platform for on-demand, microwavable gourmet meals, the business did quite well. Riding on the momentum of early success, in 2015, Munchery, in a bid to outdo its rival Blue Apron, branched into offering ingredients for customers to make their own meals (and providing them the appropriate recipes to do so). The San Fransisco-based startup continued to generate a lot of media buzz and expanded into New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles soon after. They were outperforming Blue Apron and almost every other on-demand food delivery startup, attributed to the convenience their microwavable foods model brought and Munchery’s pride on the quality control they offered that other on-demand startups, who depended upon restaurants, couldn't. They also prided themselves in sourcing 100% natural ingredients and working efficiently under their schedule-ahead model that constantly optimized the efficiency of their couriers.

So what went wrong with this seemingly successful business?

Pascal Rigo, a celebrated chef who at one point served as Munchery’s Chief Customer Experience Officer, stated in his interview with the San Francisco Chronicle that “[startups] can be either a good food company or a good delivery company, but I don’t think anyone has been able to do both.” He left the company in 2015, after just 5 months of joining. Munchery’s attempt to juggle both of these titles led to difficulties at scale.

Munchery also realized late that its original heat-and-serve meals had geographical constraints, as to ensure quality, food had to be delivered within a short drive of its kitchens. To accommodate for this, Munchery accelerated its expansion, setting up expensive production kitchens in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. These proved to be too expensive both financially and logistically, and the new kitchens were shut down by May of 2018. Additionally, new competition from Uber’s Eats spinoff and DoorDash started to kick in and Munchery soon could not match the variety offered by these companies that could source from multiple restaurants.

Another area where Munchery failed was in acquiring new customers. They attempted to use aggressive discounts to achieve success in this sector, offering things like $20 off a user’s first two orders and subscription plans that offered a free 1-month subscription to first-time customers. However, despite these efforts, Munchery failed to retain customers in any significant way. These disappointments led to Tri Tran stepping down from the position of CEO, replaced by James Beriker, who employed a slew of layoffs and other belt-tightening measures. Beriker also raised prices, which would only lead to a further downward spiral for the company amidst increasing competition.

Despite its ambitious mission, Munchery could not deliver on the gourmet experience that it promised and closed its doors to users, alongside similar decisions by startups Spring and Maple—early concepts of the “ghost kitchen” that shut down and was acquired earlier in 2017, respectively.

On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase ""if only I had known sooner."" 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, Bad Blood, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early. ""disgruntled employees"" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry.

OpTier was founded when websites were the main center of attention were website-based application and their technology required months in order to provide meaningful transactions monitoring. However new companies were now able to provide the same service in a matter of hours and OpTier wasn’t quick enough to adapt to the new market expectations.

Another element that factored in OpTier becoming suddenly obsolete was the launch of the iPhone and the start of the mobile based applications. Mobile phone brought up a system of interaction compared to the later where the focus was on monitoring system performance and APM had to expand to analyze customer trends across multiple channels. Again OpTier, which had already started experience losses, lacked enough capital to implement such profound changes to its technology so as to meet the new customers’ demands."

Facebook bought Parse at a time in which its stock was trading for lower than their IPO and it was not yet confident of how far its business model based on ad-serving would take them and wanted to test other possible business ideas. Thanks to Parse, Facebook was able to create a community of mobile app developers for itself. There could have also been a brief vision of developing cloud services that would match those offered by Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. However, once the Facebook business model was consolidated in the last few years making them billions, the social network lost interest in competing with the other giants in the cloud business as it would cost them millions of dollars. They were too far behind and Parse couldn't provide them with a long-term profitable source of revenue, in fact, it was most likely losing money. Facebook decided to shut down Parse in 2017 to let the team focus on other projects.

PepperTap,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India",PepperTap is India's largest and fastest grocery delivery service. Currently present in more than 25 cities.,www.peppertap.com,"Among the reasons why the company shut down even after receiving big investment money from investors, was the deep-seated perception in customers' minds that online platforms should provide cheaper solutions to their needs. To accommodate such expectations, PepperTap offered discounts and sales which were disproportionate to their account strength. PT also failed to weigh the scalability of their project before its full-blast expansion, which caused problems related to technology. For example, certain segments of their products malfunctioned and could not be accessed by customers on the platform.

PepperTap entered the online grocery business without sufficient preparation. It failed to acknowledge the need for deep pockets, large assortment, competitive prices and inventory management.

While 2015 was a great year for startups, and PepperTap was able to find venture capitalists relatively easily, 2016 brought a different scenario. Startups all over the world faced a slowdown in VC activities, and PepperTap had to bow down to the situation. The costs that the company had to bear were high compared to the profit it made. Since they operated without their own inventory, they needed to pay for outsourcing of inventory management plus technology, operation, etc.

PT founders also pointed out that the fact the Indian market was still unprepared for this type of service factored in as a reason that caused them to suspend their operations. The delivery fee for home delivery was seen as too high, particularly in second and third tiers cities or areas where the presence of delivery boys (kirana), was common and proved to be a tough competition to the online platform strategy.

Grocery shopping is also a favorite leisure activity after work among Indians and is often seen as an activity that brings the family together, making it an additional cultural challenge to Internet grocery businesses in India.

For starters, it was hard to convince large institutions to buy from the company as a single-source network of providing texts and notes. Also, not all students were pleased with Rafter’s model as they thought they could get textbooks for more affordable prices on their own and they didn’t appreciate the fact that the company required them to return the books at the end of the term.

However, the most crucial challenge for the company was the evolution of technology and its widespread adoption and inclusion into universities. Colleges could now directly deal online with the publisher so the need to have a middle agent such as Rafter became minimal. Rafter announced its shut down in 2016. The digital assets of Rafter, including its Rafter360 solutions, were successively bought by eCampus in 2017.

The fact that they reached the market before Spotify, didn’t help them as they little momentum they initially had was completely lost once Spotify appeared on the scene.

For one, Spotify had an impressive marketing strategy and a business model that made it easier for them to gain more subscribers. While Rdio required users to become paying customers to listen to their streaming service, Spotify broke that entry barrier and offered free music thanks to the paid advertising it incorporated into its product.

Rdio tried a couple of pivoting strategies but these came too late and Spotify had already gained 75 million users (they surpassed 140 million in 2017, 50 million of which were paying subscribers). A mix of bad timing, reluctant leadership, and wrong priorities was what finally caused Rdio to go out of business.

Choosing the ‘wrong market’ was mentioned as one of their major mistakes. Since the beginning they were taken by their clients as being an open-source tool and pretty much no one wanted to pay for it. If a substantial price barrier would have been put, users would have probably searched for another tool in the ocean of free and open source tools that other developers make available. Another major blunder was that despite they focused on seemingly important metrics, these weren’t the metrics users and clients were primarily interested in. Their ‘metrics of goodness’ according to the startup were releasing a flawless product (and yet their successful competitors at MongoDB became very popular even though they had an initial buggy product), design a simple interface, and database consistency. On the other hand, customers wanted the products to be available as soon as possible (they had to wait almost 3 years for RethinkDB), speedy performance, and a good and tried way to store JSON documents and create reports.

Fortunately, enough, RethinkDB technology won’t fall into oblivion as it has been acquired a couple of months after its 2016 shutdown by the Linux Foundation (CNFC).

When they were not able to raise the next round fast enough, it disheartened a portion of the key individuals on the group. Without another financial support and having numerous key individuals worn out, RewardMe did not have any assets to push forward.

Secret moderators stated they weren’t ready to deal with the flood of negative posts and inappropriate behavior.

As cyberbullying stories increased, so did the media news that covered such stories. A court ruling in Brazil even banned Secret from the country deeming it unconstitutional since although free speech was allowed, free speech (and the harassments that said speech could contain) should not be anonymous.

The app lost traction and was eventually suspended.

Shuddle customer support was also poor and, apparently, often no one would answer or return calls. Although there were parents routinely used the app and coped with the shortcomings since there was no other similar service in the area, there was still a big chunk of parents that would try the service once and vow to never use it again for how inconvenient it was.

Adding to the service quality, there were also concerns about security since Shuddle did not subject their drivers to fingerprints background checks claiming at one point that they were too expensive for them or that they were not needed.

Their business strategy also seemed faulty. Reports state that the company lost a lot of money on several rides and that they incurred losses on every ride they made before 2016. The charged a $9 per month subscription fee plus the ever-changing fare fees, and yet was said to struggle to pay for its operational costs and employees’ salaries.

Shuddle was unable to raise funds to keep themselves afloat, no one was interested in investing or acquiring them, and they closed down in 2016.

Shyp,"San Francisco, California, United States",Shyp provides shipping services that ranges from picking-up the package to delivering it to the destination.,www.shyp.com,"Started in the summer of 2013, Shyp had everything that San Francisco-based venture capitalists were looking for. For starters, they operated on an app-based business model that was the epitome of recent on-demand service models that were scaling to take the whole world by storm and independent couriers that were personable and incentivized to often arrive before their 20-minute promised time—unsurprisingly a hit with customers. This attracted the likes of Tim Ferris, Naval Ravikant, Slow Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins among many others to participate in the company’s hefty raise of $62 million during their operations. Later on, Shyp also was able to partner with the e-commerce giant E-bay. So what happened that led to their shutdown barely 5 years into existence? 

To begin with, Shyp had vastly overestimated the number of individuals that would regularly ship their items anywhere, let alone pay a flat $5 fee for something simple as a courier picking up and packing your items, regardless of its size. On top of this flaw, they also started charging an extra $3 packaging fee for the marked-up shipping cost. Unlike essential services like cab rides and food delivery that most people would now use at least on a weekly basis, shipping items is a rare and often sporadic activity. To account for this, Shyp started to get small businesses (that ship on a regular basis) into becoming part of their shipping revolution and even started offering volume discounts. This still did not stop the company from shutting down by early 2018. 

In a personal LinkedIn article in 2018, company CEO Kevin Gibbon admits he didn’t listen. “At the time,” he wrote, “I approached everything as an engineer. Rather than change direction, I tasked the team with expanding geographically and dreaming up innovative features and growth tactics to further penetrate the consumer market.” He also said that ""growth, at all costs, is a dangerous trap that many startups fall into, mine included.” In the case of Shyp, the costs that came with packaging materials, renting out physical warehouses and hiring drivers while doing their best to keep prices low to attract customers, made for finer margins and greater demand for using up the startup capital than other ventures.

Car-hailing services depend on the traction present in the market and the network of drivers and passengers that they build. Sidecar could only become useful - and profitable - if there was always a high density of drivers and users. This is mainly where Sidecar failed. Unlike their giant competitors (Uber and Lyft) they didn't invest enough to market their product and gain customers. Uber reportedly lost almost a million in its first 6 months while it heavily focused on acquiring customers. Sidecar didn't have the backup funding to do that on a similar scale.

Also, instead of focusing on its powerful technology and the empowerment their app gave to its users, they tried to place themselves as an affordable alternative to Uber, which didn't really work for them. Weeks after shutting down on December 2015, though, they were acquired by GM.

One of the greatest challenges they faced was intense competition from other companies offering similar services. The on-demand market was particularly crowded in the food delivering space, hence they had to compete in an already saturated market where the differentiating factor was poor.

On-demand startups rely on the contact with the consumers and the perception they have of the company, SpoonRocket failed terribly at creating trust and loyalty into their customer base. Their drivers were late on deliveries, which led to dissatisfaction to customers which ended up giving them bad reviews. Furthermore, SpoonRocket’s focus was on speed and low prices rather than cooking and that might have impacted their overall direction and downfall.

Another downside with delivery-based food services like Sprig was that they did not offer a place where customers could go and have meals, while often a good dining experience and service is what entices people to become repeat customers.

Spring had a shortage of finance to run its business and faced stiff competition from other already established companies such as Seamless, UberEats, Blue Apron and Domino.

Stayzilla,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",Stayzilla is an online platform that enables individuals to research and reserve value hotels across India.,stayzilla.com,"Throughout its 12 years of operation, Stayzilla had to deal with a varied number of challenges.

The potential for a business like Stayzilla was huge, especially because they were among the first companies in India to venture into the sector and make use of technology. However, being the first mover meant also that people were not very familiar with the concept, nor how to take advantage of the service and basically many didn’t even know how to use the internet. So Stayzilla’s first efforts and resources had to be directed towards both educating the market as well as essentially creating homestays.

As more competitors joined the market, various companies tried to differentiate themselves by offering frequent discounts. But Stayzilla’s operations costs were already too high and they were losing money every year. The CEO also mentioned that they had also lost focus on the essential mission they had envisioned for the company.

The company has not been declared officially closed, though, as the CEO considers this a pause to regain clarity and plans to return on the scene with an improved service and a ‘clean slate’ soon.

Sunrise differentiated itself in that it worked as a native app and could integrate seamlessly with other applications, and yet it’s challenging to have large customers base when there are plenty of products that do the same job for free.

So, the company shut down because of two main reasons: difficulty in finding new customers and the ability to profit from the customers. Although the sunrise app offered certain attractive features like it’s linkage to Microsoft outlook, the future of calendars has never looked more than the past. Sam Lessin, a Facebook executive commented, there are many “non-monetizable product blind spot [..] that people want but that are not good businesses.” Sunrise was purchased by Microsoft in February 2015.

Take Eat Easy,"Uccle, Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest, Belgium",The best restaurants in Paris delivered to your door.,takeeateasy.fr,"One of the main problems that TakeEatEasy, as many other startups in the sector, experienced was related to capital and profit. For one, the food delivery business is especially cash demanding. The contribution margin they were able to make was not high enough to cover the fixed operational costs and the company was not able to raise a third round of funding that would have added up to the existing capital and push them till the break-even point. After signing a financing term sheet with a French state-owned logistics group, their board rejected the deal and withdrawn their offer leaving the company without a backup plan.

The competition was another factor as they were up against direct competitors of the likes of Deliveroo, UberEATS and Delivery Hero’s Foodora. In addition to that, one of their main investors ended up acquiring and aggressively investing in a direct competitor. Rocket Internet, who was the main competitor to TakeEatEasy, also invested in Delivery Hero’s Foodora. Rocket internet now owned two direct competitors to TakeEatEasy, which didn’t leave space for a balanced competition. The company tried sourcing for investors but the competitive market failed them and VCs turned them down.

The problem was also the fact that according to some reviews the tea didn’t taste better than that made in the traditional manner. The accompanying sets of cups were also delicate and high maintenance, which defeated the stated purpose the app of making the tea ritual more convenient and enjoyable. The company claimed that people were not ready nor ‘learned’ enough to appreciate the fine details that made the product so needed.

It is also plausible to think that people became skeptic of smart kitchen products when, during the same period, a similarly high-priced machine that pressed vegetable to make the ‘perfect glass of fresh juice’, the Juicero, was publicly shown to be perfectly useless.

Theranos,"Palo Alto, California, United States",Theranos was a consumer healthcare technology company.,www.theranos.com,"Elizabeth Holmes was a real sensation in the media, often featured on the covers of various business magazines and lists of top executives and innovators. On top of this, she was also honored with an interview with former US President Bill Clinton. During these media opportunities, Holmes stated that Theranos’ goal was to give people the power to have critical health information at the time it mattered and that she wanted to create a world in which no one ever had to say the phrase ""if only I had known sooner."" 

However, despite this ambitious goal, in October of 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of The Wall Street Journal questioned the validity of Theranos' technology, Holmes and her company started slipping into hotter and hotter water. The company soon found itself facing legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities and investors. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorney generals, former business partners, and former patients among other parties got involved in uncovering the fraud and by June of 2016, it was estimated that Holmes's personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing following Holmes’ charging of wire fraud, among a list of other accusations. Soon after this, in September 2018, Theranos ceased operations. 

So what exactly happened here? Why did it take over a decade to expose this company? 

The story begins much earlier in 2002 when Elizabeth Holmes arrived at Stanford University with her breakthrough ideas. Holmes wanted to build a patch that would scan the wearer for infections and through its results, release the necessary antibiotics a patient needed. However, Dr. Phyllis Gardner, Holmes’ professor, tried to explain to her that the antibiotics Holmes wanted to use needed to be given at higher doses than a patch could deliver and that her idea would be difficult to implement. Undeterred, Holmes went on to drop out of Stanford University in 2003 at the age of 19 to start Theranos, then called Real-Time Cures under the disproven premise. As John Carreyrou points out in his thrilling non-fiction masterpiece, Bad Blood, Holmes had an unusual obsession with Steve Jobs that manifested in an obsessive copying of Job’s dressing style and making her employees read his books. Holmes had also infamously claimed that her device would soon be the “iPod of healthcare.” This “Apple complex” that Holmes possessed also led her to spy on her employees and demanded absolute loyalty from them.  

As Holmes’ scaled Theranos up and members of the team inevitably found out about the fabled, fraudulent technology, as the company scaled up operations, various early. ""disgruntled employees"" were fired, threatened, and sued for trying to expose the reliability of the technology that Holmes claimed as revolutionary. The fraud was exposed when a former employee during the peak years of the company, Tyler Shultz, had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and under an alias, reported the company to the New York State Department of Health. Despite ardent efforts by Holmes trying to get Rupert Murdoch to shut down the story that Carreyrou published on her, everything came crumbling downhill for what’s gone down as possibly one of the biggest frauds ever in the healthcare industry.

In order to cope with the recession and maintain their position above the margin, manufacturers started to sell their stored products at heavily discounted prices, this provided online flash sell companies with the perfect momentum to rise and thrive. Once the economy started improving, though, and customers regained their purchasing power, flash sales marketplaces started seeing a steady decrease in sales. At the same time, luxury brands rapidly recovered from the previous economic crisis and continued once again to produce their high-end product. Manufacturers decided to not let their high-end brands sell for bargain prices anymore and abandoned the idea of participating in flash sales in order to maintain their reputation and stable income. This meant that flash sales lost their core attractiveness and became generally obsolete. The momentum ended and so did the future of the company.

Yik Yak,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States",Yik Yak is a location-based social network that helps you connect with the people around you.,www.yikyak.com/home,"One of the main reasons that pushed the founders of Yik Yak to discontinue the application seems to be the frequent complaints about cyberbullying and harassment perpetrated through the app. Parents, feminist groups, and victims of harassments, in particular, requested schools and campuses to block the app.

Eventually, Yik Yak developers used geo-fences to block the use of the app in schools and high schools. Moreover, in an attempt to reduce the feeling of anonymity and increase accountability for the posts shared, the app tried to enforce a handle with which to identify its users. This new update only caused the number of users to decrease, and the feature was made optional.

Some argued that any platform that grants anonymity could potentially be at risk of becoming a hub for hate speech and harassment, and yet few of them actually see the prevalence of that type of behavior. The issue with Yik Yak seemed to be the fact that it was a social app based on proximity. This means that victims of any type of attack had the certainty that whoever wrote the threatening posts was physically close to them, increasing their anxiety and feeling of endangerment.

Another concern emerged when a team of researchers demonstrated that a Yik Yak user could be identified if it shared the same WiFi network of the potential attacker.

The attempted enforcement of handles, the removal of certain features, the wide coverage of news media of cyberbullying that took place through the app, security concerns, and the fact that the app stopped being relevant outside of campuses, all these factors slowly led to the decline in the use of the application and its inevitable shut down.

It failed to receive financial backing needed to fulfill their main goal of making the internet great. After barely six months of operation, Verelo announced its closure and was acquired by Dyn an infrastructure service company in January 2013. Dyn the acquirer was a pioneer in cloud-based infrastructure (Dyn was then acquired by Oracle in 2016). It connected users with digital contents and awesome experiences across the internet. By rolling in Verelo, Dyn was able to offer more innovative services to their customers.

Verelo also faced stiff competition from other firms as it was difficult to convince customers that your service is better unless you offered something groundbreaking or without users having expertise on monitoring technology and businesses and were able to make informed decisions. Moreover, people would mostly sign up once and rarely visit the website again because since they wouldn’t experience any major issue.

Reach.ly,Latvia,"Reach.ly was an analytics tool for e-commerce sites providing actionable customer behavior patterns. It engaged in a real-time analytics infrastructure, which allowed e-commerce sites engage with their customers through customized messages.",,"Reach.ly had purposed two objectives before its closure in 2015. Its iterations were behavioral analytics for e-commerce and Twitter mining solutions for hotel industries. The company, by the CEO own admission, failed because it mixed up ideas and models of the previous business into the new venture. Reach.ly did not start afresh but kept all the previous undertakings in operation. It lacked room for other investors and only survived on the CEO shares. Secondly, technology failed them terribly. It started out big but it did not scale up, the regret was that it could have started with a simple stack to test the idea. The free hosting received from Soft layer led the company to spend too much on technology without a single customer or a working prototype.

Lack of proper market feedback and pilot client was also a setback. It did not create appropriate tracking solution and their data set had loopholes. Without any consultation, they switched to another platform called Shopify with standardized API and app marketplace. It turned out that the Shopify players were smaller than expected and thus failed to serve Reach.ly goals. Lastly, the initial team recruited was heavily technology-centric and lacked teamwork, passion and business vision. A big part of the team eventually left the firm or was let go; precious time and resources were spent to find a new committed and talented team. Had this been done from the beginning the company might have has a better chance of succeeding.

Monitor 110,United States,Monitor 110 was an information and data gathering service that offered real-time internet monitoring services for Wall Street. It allowed investors to monitor internet sources for information and insight relevant to their investment and portfolio management.,,"Monitor 110 closed down its operations in July 2008 due to various reasons.

First, there wasn’t a clear leadership at the top levels. Monitor110 was directed by two people that had completely different backgrounds - which per se is not a bad thing - but that also had different perspectives when it came to decision making. The company also waited too much before releasing their product also due to the fact that they received substantial publicity (for example, they were featured by the Financial Times) before they had a thoroughly tested release. This got people’s expectation high and made the company reluctant to release a less than perfect product. The fact that they received $17 million might have also been counterproductive for them, as instead of building a lean beta version they kept developing the product in a vacuum based on their vision for it rather than receiving valuable feedback from customers. A technical problem they also faced was related to the amount of spam and duplicate posts that the algorithm was picking up on, it was too much and it could have diminished the value of the platform. When they finally decided on a suitable business pivot after months of indecisiveness, the company had already started running out of money and there was an unpleasant tension between the company team. The company lost also the edge they could have had in such a competitive market as theirs and decided to shut their operations in 2008.

Poliana,United States,"Poliana established with an aim of bringing order to the chaos in the political system of the United States of America. It initially tried to do that by providing a gateway for communication between politicians and their citizens. After the pivot, they started creating and designing data visualization tool using their data set for institutions like schools.",https://www.poliana.com/,"Poliana had low market demand and ran out of finances even though they tried to implement three different business models with schools, news agencies and the public at large.

The idea of creating a data visualization tool for school and university students did not work. To penetrate in the schools required strong connection to the school administrators, which the company did not have. It was difficult to make money from projects that were meant to be free to the public. There was no demand for viewing graphs which the public had to pay for first. Poliana allowed the public to see the graphs, but to make their own data they had to pay via SaaS model thus incurring expensive charges. Poliana also attempts with local news media were unsuccessful as they had little interest in what the company offered while middle news media were interested but lacked the budget for visualization data technology. International and national media had their own set of experts and data hence the information offered by the company was irrelevant.

There was a fourth profit model that was suggested by many users but which Poliana decided not to pursue. The model involved selling visualization data and information to politicians. The Poliana team argued that the model might compromise their ethics and go against their very principles when they started the project hence they refrained from creating it. Poliana decided to share their code and open source it in its entirety and suspended their operations in 2015.

Design Inc.,United States,Design Inc. was a startup that linked clients to talented designers. Clients would post on the site the projects they needed to get done. Design Inc. allowed designers to autonomously send proposals for the projects they would like to work on while charging a small fee for it. ,,"Design Inc. reached market saturation after some time. The number of projects and companies were not increasing and the startup could not make enough revenue to cover operation costs. This put the company in a low cash situation and they founder took the decision to close it down.

Design Inc. CEO identified a number of reasons that he believed contributed to the failure of his company. He stated that he should have been more focused on the essentials of business, which is getting more leads and profit. He also mentioned that a startup founder should also test his assumptions and keep on optimizing the product in every little way. Team members should also be encouraged to experiment without fear.

Another broader issue that is not exclusively linked to Design Inc. may be with the business model itself since the design field is considered a top-end market where job posts are scarce by nature. Too many designers compete for only a limited number of design jobs, thus causing the market to saturate too soon. Another reason why the company might have not witnessed a growth in its network could have been due to the fact that although designers are introduced to the clients by Design Inc. platform, in the end, they might decide to continue their business transactions independently from the marketplace.

Alikolo,Indonesia,"Alikolo was an eMarketplace organization started in 2014, in Indonesia. The organization's goal was to address purchasers' issues from an online stage. Alikolo’s model was such that sellers could list their product in the e-marketplace and buyers could access the sites to make their purchases.",,"As a matter of first importance, the author, Taniwan did not have a clear vision of the quality of the organization in connection to its rivals and that might be because its eMarketplace idea lacked uniqueness. This is highlighted by Taniwan inability to give a reason for which a customer should purchase at Alikolo specifically instead of purchasing from their rivals.

One of the significant slip-ups that Alikolo made was to offer the greater part of the organization’s stake to speculators. This put the founder as a minority investor and limited its involvement and influence in some aspects of the business. This kind of business structure, where the CEO becomes a minority investor frightened off other potential speculators and therefore, Alikolo failed to secure a second round of financing. This eventually prompted absence of adequate assets that could have been used to scale up the organization and assemble an aggressive and more successful platform. Ultimately, the major obstacles that Alikolo faced were internal since it had its leadership lacked experience in both designing and running an organization.

HitMeUp,United Kingdom,HitMeUp was a web-based business commercial center situated in London. Its zone of specialization was instant and area-based promotions.,,"By its own admission, HitMeUp founder had no tech background when he launched the startup. Although he was well versed in the business management side and had the capital to develop his idea early on, his total dependence on someone else to develop his vision proved to be a risky thing. His idea took too much time to see the light and this brought about inflated costs.

When they finally launched Version 1, they discovered that businesses were particularly bad at selling their own product, and published post and promotions that were badly written and accompanied them with unappealing photographs of the products they were trying to sell. Furthermore, when they had a sale they didn’t want to promote it to their customers and thus lose clients who would have paid the full price for the item. They expected HitMeUp to attract a new customer base they could then sell to.

This problem was solved in the second Version where the startup provided a customer-oriented app through which businesses could promote their sales directly on the mobile environment for HitMeUp users to discover and take advantage of.

Another problem the team discovered was that using Facebook online business proved to be both awkward and not carefully conceived as people when on the platform to get in touch with their friends and usually weren’t in the particular mood for shopping, and if they were, they often ended up buying from their trusted platforms.

Finally, when experimenting with the third Version of their product they focused on a mobile-only application, which again proved unsuccessful. The app had plenty of businesses of all type of sort that were ready to sign up, but the startup hadn’t done extensive marketing outreach for their business and their users were few to enable them to scale up and sustain their business model. When business discovered that they no one showed up to redeem their coupons, they would understandably stop using the app. The failure of all the three versions eventually led to the closure of the company but was definitely an enhancing experience for the HitMeUp team.

SchoolGennie,India,"SchoolGennie’s ambition was to help Indian schools, and India’s educational sector at large, to focus on and improve child development by providing management solutions that saved time, reduced overall costs and help make better administrative decisions. SchoolGennie introduced an ERP (electronic records portal) platform for schools which included services such as the Competitive Edge Software and Cloud Software Service.",,"The startup took off in 2013 but had to shut down it within a year. One of SchoolGennie co-founders detailed in a post the factors that caused the death of the company.

The first and most fatal of them was probably not having any experience in the educational sector and not testing their product for market fit. They've also tried to delay the release of the product to ‘perfect it' instead of testing the waters with an MVP, thus increasing production costs and losing time. Spending money on unnecessary office furniture instead of spending it on hiring experienced developers was also on their miss list. When they realized that schools and teachers weren't interested in their product they tried to copy their competitors with little success as they had no expertise in the services they were trying to add, to begin with. Within a few months, the team started losing sight of their initial vision and paid too much heed to outside influences. This caused a divide between the two founders which caused delayed decisions and uncertainty. Again, most of these problems could have been avoided had they had a mentor, which admittedly, they didn't search eagerly enough for.

SellanApp,The Netherlands,SellanApp sought to be the solution for people who had a great idea for an app but no resources or experience to actually materialize it on their own. The startup provided a crowdfunding model that would connect people with interesting apps concept with experienced app developers.,,"SellanApp targeted people without coding expertise or funds to make their App ideas emerge. Their App was initially successful and they took a step for App store optimization and worldwide promotion but this never lasted.

One reason Sellan App failed was linked to an unhealthy partnership whereby the two co-founders weren’t able to jointly run the business and there was a lack of transparency in terms of how the company was actually doing. They failed to have constructive dialogues on how to move forward or improve the platform. The company seemed to have lost focus multiple times, raising seed investments but never really changing their business model. The company finally suspended its services and filed for bankruptcy although it’s still not clear what exactly caused their finances to get out of control.

37Coins,United States,37Coins has been developing new Bitcoin technologies for the hottest new markets for Bitcoins such as the Philippines and Singapore.

The company’s effort to provide Bitcoin transfer technologies across different regions has proved to be nearly impossible for the company. These are the two main reasons for the company’s shutdown:

37Coins stated that delivering monetary funds across different carriers outside of the USA was “Unreliable.”

Furthermore, 37Coins said that their “initial objective was not possible to achieve with the amount of capital raised.” The startup stopped its operations mainly because of lack of sufficient funds. The mere maintenance of the servers that they had developed required a big chunk of capital investment itself, not to mention that the company had several of these server’s set-up all over the globe.

EventVue,United States,EventVue was as a social private network whose aim was to assist online communities to have a better conference networking experience. This platform helped attendees connect from different parts even before they met at the conference.,,"EventVue shutdown in February 2010, due to the fact that it lacked product-market fit and failed to test early on their assumptions about the usefulness of the product from their target customers view.

EventVue co-founder Josh Fraser wrote in a postmortem that EventVue was a Vitamin instead of a painkiller, the platform was ‘nice to have’ but not necessarily needed by conference organizers. Despite the fact that organizers thought it was a good platform for connectivity and interaction, they weren’t particularly interested in paying for it since it didn’t bring them any additional revenue, cut any of their expenses or make their business any better. Being able to sell more tickets was the primary focus of conference organizers and their product wasn’t addressing that need.

Discovering this, EventVue decided to take a different approach by introducing the EventVue Discover widget which automatically notified people about who else would be attending the conference in hope that this would increase ticket sales for the event. However, this feature backfired at them and sales actually dropped. It seemed that most attendees used the widget to check if friends and acquaintances would attend and when they learned that no one they knew didn’t sign up they refrained from purchasing conference tickets.

Besides, if people had markets and superstores close to them (as it is often the case in developed countries), there would be no need for them to order ingredient when they could go themselves and buy what they needed. Dinnr concentrated on providing and delivering ingredient but the reality is that most potential customers would have rather ordered ready-made meals instead of only ingredient which will then have to prepare. And while the product might have been useful in some cases, the demand for the product was low and it resulted in low-profit margin.

The Dinnr team seems to have developed a product that they personally liked without conducting thorough market research first. They conducted few interviews and concentrated on marketing their service rather than inquiring on the challenges the average customer faces with grocery shopping. They overlooked the fact that pitching a product instead of conducting solid market research gives great statistics on paper but will often lead to nothing but disappointment after the product launches.

Moreover, when starting out, Dinnr, set high monthly goals for themselves but they were too ambitious and failure to meet their own expectations might have dealt them an ulterior mental blow.

Flipkart is India’s largest e-commerce company. The company has been serving their customers mainly on their online website, Flipkart.com, but things started to change when Flipkart saw how lucrative mobile phone apps were becoming. For over the last few years, the company noticed that their overall traffic mostly came from smartphones and tablets. The only logical move for the company to maximize their profits was to move on and develop a mobile phone-based application for their e-commerce website.

At first, PoliMobile began as a software-as-a-benefit (SaaS) platform and later updated into a Mobile application that could be utilized over an assortment of campaigns.",,"PoliMobile had a few major issues.

First of all, no one wanted to pay for such a service, and they doubted it could be more effective than the traditional campaigning methods that were already being used. Numerous campaigns agreed to accept trials but never ended up becoming paying customers and the founder realized that during the preliminary take-off stages he never actually asked politicians and people in charge of campaigns if and how much they would actually pay for such a product.

The founder also believed that PoliMobile might have been launched at the wrong time, because, although the technology was functioning well, its target market might have not been yet ready to use it.

The startup’s founder, who had a decade of experience in the touring business, experienced first hand how the logistics of touring can be challenging, especially for small musicians. ",,"One of the fundamental reasons the company’s CEO for the failure of his company was that he focused on a market that was too small, and since they only charged a small commision per transaction, the business model set was not sustainable and would not cover for operations costs. Second, there was lack of a good product-market fit. Musicians might have told the founder that Sharingear was a great and functional product but cash-strapped musicians might resort to opting for the most economical arrangement, even if it’s not the most convenient. Furthermore, there is to factor in that musical instrument and gear are very delicate and although the company insured every rented instrument, some people might feel reluctant to rent their own instrument or take someone else’s for fear of somehow damaging it. There’s also the fact that musicians usually develop a preference to their own playing gear and performing with a rented one might have required some getting used to.

Sharingear, running out of budget and with fleeting employees, was not able to adapt and pivot soon enough and closed in late 2015.

Lumos,India,Lumos was an Internet of Things startup that sought to provide customers with the ultimate smart switching technology. The first-time entrepreneurs who came with Lumos wanted to create internet-connected devices that used machine learning and could adjust and personalize home appliances settings based on the behavior and routines of the user.,,"Lumos had to shut down in less than a year and the founders recognized that they “were not the right team to build a hardware company”. The founders admitted to at least seven major problems that lead to the downfall of the company.

First of all, they were working in a sector in which they had no expertise in. They’ve also overestimated the utility value of the product and somehow disregarded the fact that the product needed to be sold about five times higher than the production costs to be profitable. Instead, they had designed a product that would not have been by any means cost-effective.

Lumos had no customer persona it could target its marketing to and the startup ended up trying to sell the product both as an energy saving device and a luxury utility. The founders tried to make Lumos make too many things too soon driven by the illusion that often blinds inexperienced entrepreneurs that they were smarter than the rest of the lot and could beat their competitors easily. And to top it all, there was a lack of communication and transparency between the startup team towards the late part of their venture. They started to keep their doubts to themselves instead of working on solving them.

Most of the reasons that caused Lumos failure could have been avoided had the founders sought the counselor mentorship of an experienced entrepreneur or business analyst early on. But then again, maybe they were supposed to learn each of the lessons that the journey presented them with on their own skin so as to be better prepared for the launch of their next startup.

Desti,United States,"Desti -a spin-out from SRI International- was a traveling and mapping iPad app that used AI to help its user plan their trips and find the best destination based on their preferences. After the user set his preferences the app would essentially work as a search engine finding hotels, restaurants or any other location based on the data and reviews found online regarding said destination. ",,"Desti wasn’t a faulty app on its own, nor were its services obsolete. The problem seemed to be that although users found the application to be useful and appreciated its location suggestions, they ultimately ended up doing the booking from other more trusted platforms or known brands. It followed that due to its failure to generate revenue from its service, investments came short in the Series A round.

There was also the fact that Desti was a newcomer in a sector which had already several giants such as TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet competing against themselves and to which users automatically resorted to.

Desti was ultimately acquired by Nokia with several members of the Desti team also ending up joining the Finnish multinational company. Nokia said that it planned to use the powerful semantic back-end search engine technology provided by Desti to enhance Nokia’s maps platform, creating thus a revolutionary type of location services that understands and perhaps anticipates users’ destination preferences.

In the later stages of the e-commerce business, it became evident that Wantful was not getting the kind of growth curves that venture capitals expected and desired and as a result failed to secure additional investment. This highly discouraged business with Nordstrom, a potential investor and strategic partner that Wantful heavily depended on for their long-term investment. The company closed in 2013.

The site offered heavily discounted invite only flash sales to its customers and gained huge popularity and rave reviews in its first operational months. ,,"The main culprit for the downfall of the popularity of Zulily is poor marketing and user-attention strategies. Most notably, in order to access the search engine and databases of Zulily’s shopping items, the platform required from new visitors to give their email address prior to even seeing what the online store had to offer. This marketing trick met with a lot of criticism since it violated some basic marketing principles. Zulily initially achieved a record success with the number of new subscribers who registered on the site, but Zulily team soon noticed that sales began rapidly to decline. People gave their mail only to peek at the site and registered users couldn’t necessarily be considered loyal or even willing customers. Zulily inadequate marketing strategy and front-page email request discouraged thousands of potential new customers to sign up, while their existing users often bought only once or anyway not enough to sustain the financial stability of the company. Users also stated that they felt overwhelmed by the number of merchandise and flash sales invitation the e-shop offered so the company complied by diminishing them, and a decrease in revenue also followed.

Moreover, although Zulily sometimes offered brand names for ridiculously small prices, there would often be longer than expected delivery times to customers which also earned them poor reviews.

No one had a clear vision of the product, and founders kept adding features even before having a consolidated trial version. Moreover, Crowdmix lacked a clear  HR policy. This led to overstaffing and consequently contributing to the high running costs, with people being hired to ‘raise the company profile’ rather than because they actually provided a service for the company.

Berg,United Kingdom,"Berg was a cloud platform on which Little Printer, an Internet-of-Things device, worked on. Berg allowed users to print out interesting news from the web, social media, etc. across devices",,"Berg had an interesting journey from the boardroom to folding the business; they tried to change their business model a couple of times halfway through it but to no avail.

Besides the fact that the product that they created served a very limited market need (if ever a need was there) paper consumption and the creation of waste was an element that turned many people that cared about the environment away.

Berg’s little Internet of Things device had a small group of supporters, which, while loyal, could not convert into a sustainable way to maintain and manage the business. People also argued that the advertisement put out by Berg failed to show how the little printer working on the Berg platform could improve users' life. It was, objectively speaking, more a luxury item/toy rather than a device that anyone would need.

While print newspapers are struggling to continue their existence, it was hard for Berg to convince people that they needed the Little Printer in their homes. Moreover, publishing content through the Little Printer would need to weigh in the design factor of the publisher’s needs. Only certain type of contents could fit on the receipt-size paper the device could print. Also, because of its size, the commercial sector would not be that interested in it.

However, people can be irrational and buy products on a whim only because they are cute and “new” but the price tag given to Little Printer made the product even more difficult to sell. Berg’s CEO also admitted that one of the main reasons for his company's failure was that they priced their products at above the level of consumer’s willingness to pay, $259; pretty expensive for a toy.

The major obstacle Shipbeat encountered was the unwillingness of the main shipping carriers in Denmark to cooperate with the e-commerce platform. In other words, there were few of them who maliciously tried to stop the intentions of Shipbeat to reduce the overall logistics costs by re-selling what they initially had to offer.

The other serious problem they had to face, was when Shipbeat tried to expand their logistic services in other market areas. They had difficulties while trying to integrate a new set of carriers into their operations since forming new partnerships was often a negation heavy and slow process and they had not enough influence or user base to gain the full attention of critical carriers in new regions.

Moreover, from the technological and logistic side, any big or minor change often created an additional hustle for all parties involved, from the carriers to the customers as well as potential warehouses.

After the idea of reaching out to a shipping broker as a possible solution failed, the company declared bankruptcy.

Selltag failed to respond to the ever-growing needs of upgrading the contents of the app to make them more user-attractive.

Wesabe,United States,Wesabe is a former Personal Finance Management system which served its clients by helping them make better financial decisions by analyzing the client’s available financial options based on the data that the clients provided Wesabe with.,,"The tragic downfall of Wesabe can be ascribed to two major reasons.

To understand the first one, we need to talk about Yodlee. Yodlee is a company that offers an automatic data aggregation system for PFMs. This was usually done by screen-scraping the client’s bank account website activity on the supported bank corporations by Wesabe. This information is then transferred to the PFMs own platform for them to analyze. On a meeting with Wesabe, both parties never agreed to close the deal since Wesabe referred to Yodlee as a “crumbling corporation” and was afraid they wouldn’t be able to follow through. Because of these instances, Wesabe opted for a different solution. Instead of working with Yodlee, Wesabe chose to make their own data acquisition program with was to supposedly have better privacy settings for clients. This move, however, later resulted in Wesabe losing to Mint - their main competitor- since Wesabe’s data acquisition system was never fully finished. Instead, when Mint launched into the market a few months after Wesabe, it had its own data aggregation system, all thanks to their partnership with Yodlee.

Apart from that, there was also the fact that Mint provided a better and easier user experience. Mint’s system automatically categorized and edited the client’s data which resulted in a better consumer experience. While Wesabe’s clients needed to fill out more fields on sign up forms, etc. which was a little bit of a hassle for most people which often opted for the easier choice even though Wesabe’s platform was more precise and would have helped them make better financial decisions on the long run.

Effectively, the only strategy that could have realistically turned out to be profitable for Stereomood was acquisition as they weren’t able to make profit in any other way since companies such as Spotify already ruled the market.

Kiko,United States,"Kiko was an Ajax-style online calendar application that offered advanced features that included API integration with other websites and applications on the Internet. The app was particularly helpful to business professionals, event organizers, etc.",,"Kiko lasted for just three years. The founders have moved to work on other projects, but they explained the reasons for their startup’s failure in a post.

The first reason according to one of the founders was that their team had wanted to work on various ideas and plans at the same time, this diverted their attention from their main project and ended up creating delays. The CEO admitted that they were too slow at times and wasted time on unnecessary things and neglected other matter that was instead crucial. To make it worse, they hired a wrong team member which affected the company’s productivity as he didn’t complete any task and disappeared for months. Failure to involve investors and seek their guidance from the beginning was also another blunder.

The software that powered Kiko was put for sale on eBay and it was bought for $258,100 in an auction.

Although their product anticipated market needs, its market entry timing didn't work out for them.

Springpad started facing financial difficulties that forced it to start looking for additional funding and even contemplating acquisition by major web players. In the end, Springpad was acquired by Google. The major reason for the shutdown was having a short-sighted focus and failure to develop a good strategy that supported its product.

Friendster,Philippines,"Friendster was a social gaming site and can be considered the first prototype of social networking sites as we know them. It was widely popular in the Asian region and boasted about 115 million registered users in 2011. Through the platform, users could take part in online games, send messages, write comments, post media and share content with other users publicly or privately.",,"Friendster seemed like a fun place to hang out, with all the right bells and whistles to lead the way, what went wrong, then?

Friendster did two things particularly well: it offered social gaming and it gave users reasons to keep coming back to its platform. What it seemed to have missed creating, instead, was an actual social network. If one had to point out a major point that made Facebook soar, and that Friendster and other similar sites didn’t catch up with, was the presence and the emphasis put on the social news feed feature.

Gaming is fun, but only until a certain point, while social interactions - of any kind, really - are always sought after by people. By making the news feed the central part of its platform, Facebook ensured that people always had new things to interact with that somehow was still connected to them or their circle of friends. It offered a never-ending stream of new posts and pictures to like or comment on and it shifted away from the previous focus which was to curate and polish one’s own profile, which was exactly still one of Friendster’s focus. User use and registration declined and the company struggled to regain influence and shut down.

TeeBeeDee,United States,TeeBeeDee was a social network launched in 2007 that was aimed at people over 40. It was well built and designed featuring many of the elements that made others social networks successful. ,,"As the network’s CEO put it “the site’s business model wasn’t able to grow its user base big enough and fast enough to survive”.

Middle-aged people might have signed up out of curiosity but the platform probably didn’t have the same traction and influence that sites which aim at a younger demographic have. It’s more likely that it is mainly teenagers and people in their twenties who are more prone be active in online social platforms, inviting friends, sharing content and spending time on it. LinkedIn is an exception here. Linkedin has a user base of 192 million users who are aged 30 and over, yet the network was successful and gained traction because its central focus was on building business connections. It was later able to transform part of its users to consumers by offering premium plans, acting as a recruiter company and introducing business-oriented courses. TeeBeeDee had nothing of the sort and it was essentially an interesting place to go to when you had some time (i.e. not very much when you are an adult with a family and a work overload), instead of a place that you had to or needed to check every day.

And lastly, within few years of TBD’s launch, a plethora of social networking sites emerged and TeeBeeDee’s site views kept declining. The project failed to gather ulterior funding and it shut down in 2009.

The two-axis tracker system they came up with was the first of its kind and it was supposed to be an upgrade from the one-axis solar trackers present in the market. What happened, though, was that the technology and the efficiency of their competitors in the single-axis sector improved so rapidly that it made the traditional product more cost-effective and optimized than what QBotix came up with.

Adding to that, investors realized that the market acceptance and adoption of QBotix weren't as fast as they were expecting it to be so funding started to dwindle. QBotix then tried to license the product and provide its software for other companies to use, but the move wasn't successful and they had to lay off their staff and announce the shutdown of their operations.

Zoomo,India,"Zoomo was a Bangalore-based company that started with the goal of building trust in the Indian used cars market. Unlike many car portals, Zoomo did not open up their marketplace to other car dealers. Instead, it decided to only list cars after thoroughly inspecting them.The car would then be sold through peer-to-peer transactions.",,"What killed Zoomo wasn’t lack of funding. In fact, the three Indian founders decided to close shop and return the money to investors when they still had half of the raised capital in the bank. They also seemed to have a great team of talented and committed people.

The problem the venture had was more related to the Indian market itself. The buy-and-sell automobiles market was relatively young in India and many of the people that would come to Zoomo’s site would often be first time buyers or sellers who had close to no experience in the car transaction market. Customers, in particular, would often like a certain model but when they checked the price for a similar model on other marketplaces they would discover that it would often be lower, not realizing that there might have been hidden reasons for the slashed price tags. They weren’t able to assign standardized prices to cars based on their conditions, model and features and the haggling was deeply rooted in the Indian culture. So, their estimation was that for every 100 cars they inspectioned they sold only 20, which would not have been sustainable. They changed their strategy and decided to have a base price for the car and have inspections performed as an added service for an additional cost. The modification allowed to sell slightly more cars but not enough.

Zoomo’s team concluded that the Indian market was not ready and that they needed a more mature environment to be able to pull off a similar model and make it scalable. After considering a merger or an acquisition for a brief period, they decided to cut their journey short and return the rest of the remaining capital.

MySpace,United States,"MySpace was originally launched as a side project. Started as a spin-off of Friendster, it grew rapidly to become the most popular social networking site before Facebook entered the scene.",,"MySpace was founded by people in the industry and marketing sector and their perspective of the platform was since the beginning very different from that of Facebook, which nevertheless became its primary competitor. MySpace tried first to ignore Facebook, then to copy it and lastly decided to repurpose itself as a platform for artist and musicians.

There are several reasons why it’s thought that MySpace lost to Facebook. Starting from its poorly organized interface to the often-faulty technology and applications on the site, it was clear that although MySpace had a superb marketing strategy, from the technical side they were way behind other platforms. They later tried to remedy these problems by offering a cleaner design and allowing third-party companies to provide applications for the site.

Since MySpace revenue source was ads serving, it was pressured by investors and partners into taking an aggressive ad publishing strategy, which made their pages even less attractive to users.

In 2010, it’s estimated that 50% of MySpaces users simply left and discontinued their use of the site and that continued as the once popular site kept changing ownership and direction every few years.

Besides buggy technology and poor management, the company also faced public image issues when the site started being associated with dubious or even scandalous figures thus alarming parents and earning MySpace negative press coverage. This only accelerated users flock to other platforms such as FB that offered the additional incentive of providing users with news and interactions related to their real-life friends as opposed to anonymous people.

MySpace is currently active and receives an estimated 15 million visitors per month as of 2016 (for comparison, Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users), currently has 53 million songs on the platform and an average of 13 thousand songs uploaded every day on the platform.

Fab,"United States
","Fab is a former e-commerce company which started out as a dating site. On June 9, 2011, the owners of the site decided to entirely focus on sales and daily design inspiration.",,"Fab’s success echoed around the world, resulting in companies launching their own same exact replicas of Fab’s platform, including the Samwer brothers, who are known for launching replicas of thriving American businesses abroad like ebay, Amazon, etc. This news troubled Fab’s CEO. Jason Goldberg. To secure sales in the European region, Fab’s CEO insisted on acquiring three new startups in the region. The move to prematurely expand to Europe ultimately costed Fab over $60-$100 million dollars in capital.

A former Fab employee said that the decision to move towards Europe would’ve been fantastic if it had been done in a subsequent period, after the company became fully established in the U.S. The expansion led to serious funding issues inside the board.

Furthermore, in an attempt to solve the slow delivery rate to their customers, Fab decided to buy their own warehouse in New Jersey. This solution was initially successful as the delivery time went down from 16.5 days to only 5.5 days.  This became the perfect opportunity for Fab to exponentially grow their product inventory. Sales rose up rapidly but what the company didn’t immediately seem to realize was that by scaling up their inventory, they would lose their competitive edge for which they were known for, “providing personal and intimate designs”. The company focused too much of the funds on several initial marketing campaigns which led people into buying an initial product but didn’t help in developing customer purchase patterns they could rely on. The plan on expanding their product inventory backfired as customers realized that they could find the same products for a cheaper price and a faster delivery on Amazon. Customers left Fab in exchange for a better service from Amazon.

In the middle of 2014, CEO Jason Goldberg concluded that it was better to sell the remaining parts of Fab to a prospective company.  In the end, the $1-billion-dollar worth company was sold to PCH Innovations for only $15 million dollars.

Fuhu,United States,"Fuhu Inc. is most famously associated with the Nabi series of Tablets. Among the first product they came up with was urFooz which were digital trading cards, urDrive a software that permitted devices to install and run the applications straight from a USB device, and Fooz Kids a mobile device platform which was a safe browser for kids that enabled access to only selected areas of the internet. ",,"Fuhu went bankrupt, even though it ranked 1st on the Inc 500 companies list for two years in a row.

The company amassed an enormous amount of debt and had a very high burn rate. The level of disregard for any type of financial management was so high that the firm had only one accountant and one bookkeeper despite its 300+ employees.

Fuhu had one good idea which brought them to the top, but could never replicate it and kept borrowing money in the millions from various companies with the hope that they will be able to produce the next Nabi and break even.

In particular, Fuhu owed Foxconn, a Chinese hardware manufacturer, between $60 million to $110 million. The Chinese giant had previously already demanded from Fuhu to restrict its operations costs but little was done on that front. Suddenly the company just decided to stop backing up Fuhu and everything fell apart for the private U.S. based company.

Later, Mattel purchased Fuhu’s assets for just $21.5 million. Fuhu’s CEO, Robb Fujioka, still hopes to come back with alternative ideas that will revolutionize the world and seems to have considered Fuhu’s faith as an experience every major entrepreneur faces at some point of their career.

The database would prompt smooth exchanges processing, with consistent work process in every aspect of the E-organizations.",,"Following three years of successful business, ArsDigita began encountering a descending pattern in April 2000. Their decline was ascribed to the procuring of an inexperienced external CEO and the enablement of more power to the financial supporters of the startup. The new group of leaders utilized twofold the speculation beforehand, declined a lucrative offer by Microsoft that could set the organization upon an upward trajectory, and disliked the key organization item, ACS, even though it had repeatedly been used to take care of genuine business issues and made the organization one of a kind and effective.

To exacerbate the situation, they supplanted the ACS with another, mostly closed-source programming bundle that was difficult to utilize, had genuine execution issues and met just a little part of the business needs. Also, they fundamentally expanded the cost of the task by multiplying the number of representatives and making new, generously compensated official positions. The new administration likewise misused the funding. The situation kept on deteriorating until the company finally shut shop in April of 2001.

The company, previously known as BookRenter, initially focused only on providing textbooks to educational institutions but decided to completely change strategy to gain an upper hand on its competitors. The company rebranded as Rafter and started providing cloud-based course material. ",,"Rafter had much competition from the start and it had to deal with both logistical, financial and market challenges from the onset. For starters, it was hard to convince large institutions to buy from the company as a single-source network of providing texts and notes. Also, not all students were pleased with Rafter’s model as they thought they could get textbooks for more affordable prices on their own and they didn’t appreciate the fact that the company required them to return the books at the end of the term.

However, the most crucial challenge for the company was the evolution of technology and its widespread adoption and inclusion into universities. Colleges could now directly deal online with the publisher so the need to have a middle agent such as Rafter became minimal. Rafter announced its shut down in 2016.

Tutorspree,United States,"Tutorspree wanted to enhance the way tutoring is done by making it easier for students to find quality tutors in their area. Tutorspree graduated from Y Combinator in 2011 and was known as the ""Airbnb for tutors"". ",,"Tutorspree was a startup in a very seasoned and competitive sector. There is no clear-cut reason for the venture failure but analyzing some of the available information might help us shed light on possible culprits. First, it probably had to do with the founders of the company and their lack of expertise in the field. Also, Tutorspree's vision of pairing up tutors and students to meet up in person so as to create and maintain a real connection is commendable but not practical. Although indeed, in-person lessons are still very much valuable, the market -and the world- is heading on to a different direction.

It is also possible that the platform, which was initially taking 50% of the tutor’s fees, might have witnessed a decline in overall user growth because nothing could prevent tutors and students to schedule lessons without recurring to Tutorspree.com after they got to know each other.

Another problem for Tutorspree's seemed to be that the company was primarily dependent on search traffic from Google to acquire new students and tutors, and any algorithm changes could significantly reduce their traffic and in return their users.

As resources started to dwindle and funding failed to come in, Tutorspree decided to shut down. Its assets (including its user's database) were bought by Wyzant, a tutoring marketplace launched in 2005 which is still active.

Flowtab created an app that would show users a list of drinks they could order from their mobiles without having to wait for the bartender to take their order.,,"Flowtab tried various business model but could never found one that was both feasible and profitable. On paper, any bar would have wanted to use such an application. In reality, it proved quite hard for the company to get deals. This type of service requires a large number of users to be profitable since they only charged the customer $1 after they successfully placed an order. However, users don't usually stick to the same bars but would often choose a different one from week to week, and most users only used the app once or twice per month. Things could have still worked out, but when, in a promotional event they invited about hundred people to various clubs, their technology failed them and the founders resorted to serving drinks themselves to angry customers. This caused many people to leave one-star ratings for the app further thinning the chances of the app success.

Since their founding was limited they were also understaffed and a very small team had to take care of everything. After a couple more pivots and some members of the team leaving to pursue other goals, Flowtab finally decided to shut doors.

Delicious was a pretty good site before it was sold to Yahoo! in 2007. Two years later, even the founder regretted accepting the offer. Yahoo!

Launching the new version of the site after the acquisition was supposed to take 6 months, but, instead, it dragged on and didn’t see the light until two years later. The site was also buggy and there were frequent technical problems.

By that time other tools similar to Delicious were already dominating the sector, Pinterest, Trello, Evernote, Pinboard, Pocket, were only some of them. Besides the competitive factor, there is also to say that when Delicious was launched, it was very useful in searching for information through bookmarks a user or other registered people had already saved since Google was not as powerful as it currently is. When search engines started crawling and indexing billion of websites it became easier for people to find relevant content so the need for what Delicious offered decreased over the years.

The concept was simple: anyone that found interesting content could ‘digg it’ and post it on the Digg site.,,"Digg is a site that missed the opportunity to become a thriving social network. The site is still active but even one of its former CEOs posts more frequently on Twitter than on his own site.

The reason Digg failed were interlinked and quite obvious to point out in hindsight.

First of all, it failed to carry on with its mission of offering a platform that was free of any group’s agenda. As a matter of fact, anyone with a large circle of friends or with a numerous follower’s base (or the highest number of fake accounts) could message their posts to get the most amount of upvotes within hours, not because of the quality of the content of the post, but simply because of the connections that that specific ‘power user’ had. In an attempt to remedy to this, the site disabled the messaging feature it had and only allowed sharing with their friends by means of Facebook and Twitter. As you can imagine, the move didn’t do them any good, not only that, but it left their users dissatisfied (to say the least) by the newly implemented restriction.

And yet, these were not the only changes Digg’s team made that distanced its users. In 2010, Digg came back with a new design that, alas, had even fewer features. Digg v4, as it was called, did away with features such as down voting posts, saving favorites and posting videos.

Digg had the advantage of being the early mover since it was founded in 2004 and valued at $160 million in 2008, but it failed to adapt to its growing user base and renew the mission it had. Another bookmarking site, Reddit, slowly but inevitably started to catch up with it. As Digg users left the platform in 2010, there was Reddit offering them a ready and welcoming alternative. The interesting and inviting thing about Reddit, which is basically a spinoff of Digg, was that user content was encouraged and this allowed the platform to thrive. Self-promotion and publishing of one’s own content on Digg, instead, seemed to be frowned upon. Reddit valued and nurtured its community in ways Digg wasn’t able to do.

There were rumors that Digg would be brought back and improved upon as an app, but even so, by now it would face quite a bit of competition.

Vine,United States,"Vine was a video hosting social platform that allowed users to share six-second videos on the internet. Its video looping feature lured users into watching hours of funny, silly or creative content and the shareability factor helped the app gain popularity in a short amount of time. ",,"Some state that the very acquisition of Vine by Twitter, which initially brought about a wave of optimism, somehow tramped the potential growth of this video sharing service.

There’s also the fact that Vine ‘remained true to itself’ or, as others would say, failed to listen to the needs of its users to grow and develop as it user base increased and became more demanding. The failure in meeting the market needs also debilitated its ability to compete with other emerging video-centered applications such as Instagram and Snapchat.

And last but not least, Vine couldn’t find a sustainable business model as advertisers seemed to find the platform unsuitable for product promotion and Vine couldn’t manage to offer a shared revenue to video creators on the platform as YouTube did. Furthermore, whenever users gained a certain amount of popularity it wasn’t unusual that they would seek to build on that fame on other platforms and eventually discontinue their presence on Vine as the number of downloads and active users on the platform continued to decline.

Wattage,Canada,Wattage was an online platform with an ambitious goal: break the entry barrier for hardware design. The ideal future Wattage envisioned was that of a world in which anyone could customize their electronics without needing to have any in-depth knowledge in the field. ,,"Wattage founder Jeremy Bell shared in a Medium post some of the reason he thinks the startup failed.

Among the first reasons he listed was the fact that they failed to gain traction and validate the existence of market interest for the product. In the early phase of development, their main focus was on demonstrating that the idea could technically be carried out and it was taken for granted that people would see it as a needed solution. Without any proof that people would actually adopt the service, it was difficult to convince investors to fund the project.  All sorts of doubts about viability and scalability started popping up and the team couldn’t provide definitive - or convincing enough - answers.

Wattage was on many points too much ahead of its time, and the full potential of their idea might have been overlooked by prospect investors and the target market. However, in a few years, as technological advances will render customization easier, Wattage (or another company) might re-introduce the concept and carry it out in a successful manner.

Karhoo,United Kingdom,"Karhoo was a cab aggregator and price comparison tool. Through its app, users could get a glance of all the licensed taxis, regulated and private cars for hire that were in the area. The user would be shown the pricing and location of the various cars on a map and they could then book rides with their cab of choice.",,"Karhoo was out of business after barely 6 months of operation despite having an objectively innovative and useful product.

Based on the various online reports and articles, it seems that the two main reasons for Karhoo’s failure were poor management and faulty execution of a good concept.

Since the company was looking for more investors it went on a full-blown marketing campaign to entice people to use the service and show potential investors that the app was indeed widely used. As a promotional too, they offered free rides to passengers. The problem was that app codes never seemed to expire and people would use £100 worth in free rides. There was also a bug that sometimes prevented the app from accepting credit cards payments.

The CEO of Karhoo was also reported as listing large personal bills showing his lavish lifestyle including expensive shopping sprees, hair salons, $6000 treatment for his pet dog, 10-year lease of 3 New York apartment, luxurious parties, costly flights and stays in top hotels to mention some. On the other end, employees were asked to skip paychecks until Karhoo's finances got better. When the unexpected news that the company would shut down was announced, employees were also told the company didn't have enough money to pay them and that they wouldn't receive the payment for the previous month as well since the company was closing with $10,000 in its account.

Karhoo has been acquired by RCI Bank and Services in January 2017 and has been rebranded as Flit Technologies.
